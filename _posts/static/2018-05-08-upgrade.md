## Upgrade to 2.6.0

When a form contains several target tickets and a file upload field, the uploaded file was attached to all generated tickets.
Starting from the version 2.6.0 a document is attached to a generated ticket in two cases:

* if the tag ##FULLFORM## is used
* if the tag representing the file upload field is used.

When the tag of the answer itself is used, the description of the generated ticket contains a mention of an attached document.

Please take these changes into consideration to review forms containing a file upload field before production.

## Upgrade from 1.x to 2.4.0 or later

After upgrade of FormCreator to version 2.4.0 or later, users may encounter display issues. This is due to major changes on CSS of the plugin. You may need to refresh the cache of your browser with Ctrl+R or Ctrl+F5. If you plan to communicate about the new presentation of the plugin or the service catalog, introduce this simple manipulation to ensure all your users have a clean cache.
